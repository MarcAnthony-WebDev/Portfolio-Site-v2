          <h4 className="">HOW IT STARTED</h4>
          <p>
            Based in Long Island, NY, my journey into programming began in 2017
            while I was working as a bartender. It all started with tinkering
            around with Python and Java, leading to my very first project: a
            tip-out calculator for my fellow bartenders. The program calculated
            each bartenderâ€™s and barbackâ€™s share of the total tipsâ€”a simple
            idea, but one that sparked my passion for coding. From there, I dove
            into the core web development stack, building a solid foundation.
            Over time, I honed my skills further, specializing in React and
            Next.js, and turning my curiosity into a career I love.

          <h4 className="">HOW IT&apos;S GOING</h4>
          <p>
            Since I started my journey in web development, Iâ€™ve had the
            privilege of working at some amazing companies, building
            professional websites for clients that truly make an impact. Along
            the way, Iâ€™ve met incredible people in the tech community, regularly
            attending meetups in NYC to exchange ideas and grow my skills.
            Through this career, Iâ€™ve discovered not only my passion for
            creating exceptional web experiences but also a deep connection to
            the vibrant, creative community that fuels it. On a personal note,
            2024 was a milestone year for meâ€”I married the love of my life,
            making my journey even more meaningful. ðŸ˜Š

          <h4 className="">MY INTERESTS</h4>
          <p>
            My interests include many things such as playing the guitar, reading
            short stories, particularly those of the Russian greats such as
            Chekhov and Dostoyevsky, and watching Tarantino films. On my free
            time you can find me building out small projects and web apps. I
            really enjoy creating things that expedite my life in some way.
