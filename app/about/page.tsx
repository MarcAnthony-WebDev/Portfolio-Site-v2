          <h4 className="">HOW IT STARTED</h4>
          <p>
            Based in Long Island, NY, I got into programming in 2017 when I was
            still a bartender. I first started messing around with Python and
            Java. I remember my first project, a tip out calculator for my
            fellow bartenders. The program would take in the total tips as an
            input and output the share for each bartender and barback. It was a
            simple project but it really ignited my passion for programming. I
            soon after learned the core Web Development stack and later on
            specialized in React and Next.js.

          <h4 className="">HOW IT&apos;S GOING</h4>
          <p>
            Since I started in web development, I have worked at some great
            companies, met loads of fantastic people in the community, regularly
            joining meetups in NYC, and found my passion in life. I also met the
            love of my life and we married in 2024 ðŸ˜€.

          <h4 className="">MY INTERESTS</h4>
          <p>
            My interests include many things such as playing the guitar, reading
            short stories, particularly those of the Russian greats such as
            Chekhov and Dostoyevsky, and watching Tarantino films. On my free
            time you can find me building out small projects and web apps. I
            really enjoy creating things that expedite my life in some way.
